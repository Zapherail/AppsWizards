            <h1>Front-End Development</h1>
            <p>Front-end development refers to the practice of designing and implementing 
                the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of a website or application.
                 It involves translating design concepts into interactive and visually 
                 appealing digital interfaces using technologies such as HTML, CSS, and 
                 JavaScript. Front-end developers ensure that users can interact seamlessly 
                 with the site or app across various devices and browsers, while also 
                 optimizing performance and accessibility. Their work is crucial in 
                 delivering an intuitive and engaging user experience that aligns 
                 with the overall design and functionality of the product.

        <h1>Back-End Development</h1>
        <p>Back-end development involves the design, implementation, and maintenance of the 
            server-side components of a website or web application. This area of development 
            focuses on the underlying logic, databases, server configuration, and application 
            programming interfaces (APIs) that power the functionality and performance of the 
            application. Back-end developers ensure that data is efficiently processed, 
            stored, and retrieved, enabling seamless interaction between the user-facing 
            front end and the server-side systems. Their work is essential for the stability, 
            security, and scalability of the application, ensuring that it operates reliably
             and efficiently behind the scenes.

            <h1>Full Stack</h1>
            <p>Full-stack development refers to the comprehensive process of designing, 
                developing, and maintaining both the front-end and back-end components 
                of a web application. Full-stack developers possess expertise in both 
                the user-facing interface and the server-side architecture, enabling 
                them to handle the entire development lifecycle. This includes creating 
                intuitive and responsive user interfaces, implementing server-side logic, 
                managing databases, and ensuring seamless integration between all layers 
                of the application. Full-stack development is integral to delivering a 
                cohesive, efficient, and scalable digital product that meets both user 
                and technical requirements.</p>
